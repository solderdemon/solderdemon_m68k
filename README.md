# SolderDemon m68k

![Assembled rosco r2.42 mainboard, the GAL version SolderDemon m68k r1 grew from](images/mainboard-r2.42.jpg)

SolderDemon develops a line of Motorola 68k computers built from **through-hole (THT) parts**. This repository holds its mainboard: the board design, firmware, software and CPLD code. Expansion boards such as the [busboard](https://github.com/solderdemon/solderdemon_m68k-busboard) plug into its J3 expansion connector.

The mainboard is built on [rosco_m68k](https://github.com/rosco-m68k/rosco_m68k) by Ross Bamford, The Really Old-School Company Limited, and contributors. SolderDemon boards carry their own revision numbers, starting at r1; the rosco r2.x numbers are the history they grew from. The photo above is the assembled rosco r2.42 board, the GAL version that r1 grew from.

## The board: r1

r1 is the next release and is not made yet. KiCad renders of it, top and bottom:

What changed from rosco r2.42 is in the [design notes](design/README.md).
The [r1 first-order sheet](docs/ORDER_R1.md) links the factory ZIP and check reports for a
five-board prototype run.

## Develop software

For new programs, use [rosco CLI](https://github.com/solderdemon/rosco-cli) with its Docker build workflow. It creates the current starter project, builds through Docker, and can upload and monitor over UART. Follow the [quick start](docs/development.md).

## At the bench

- Start with the [hardware build guide](design/README.md) and [bill of materials](docs/BOM.md).
- Check [power and jumper settings](docs/JUMPERS.md) before applying power, particularly JP1/JP2 for FTDI power and JP3 for Flash writes.
- Use the [J3 expansion header pinout](docs/EXPANSION.md) for peripherals. J3 is the header; JP3 is a different, two-pin jumper.
- For code builds, see the [firmware and software overview](code/README.md). The [older SD card guide](docs/legacy-sd-card.md) covers earlier board revisions and is kept for code users.
