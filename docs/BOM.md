# SolderDemon m68k bill of materials

This table is based on the current r1 [KiCad CSV export](../design/kicad/solderdemon_m68k.csv). It has **30 part lines and 82 component placements**, excluding four mounting holes. The [order-package BOM](../design/CAMOutputs/solderdemon_m68k-r1-bom.csv) is generated from the same schematic. These are design BOMs, not verified purchasing lists; check the schematic, PCB footprints, and chosen supplier parts before buying components.

## Items outside the component count

- The CSV also contains **four M3 mounting holes** and **six logo or compliance artwork objects**. They are PCB features, not parts to buy.
- The bare PCB and any required programming of the ATF1502AS CPLDs (in circuit, over JTAG header J9) and Flash ROMs are not included as BOM lines. See the [PLD programming guide](../code/pld/README.md) for IC2 and IC3. Boards up to r2.13 use four ATF22V10C GALs (IC2, IC3, IC5, IC6) instead.
- The original R2 packing list separately mentioned sockets for IC1 (DIL64, 1), IC4 (PLCC44, 1), IC7 (DIL16, 1), IC15 (DIL08, 1), and U1/U2/U3/U4 (DIL32, 4). From r2.14 IC2 and IC3 also sit in PLCC-44 through-hole sockets (2 more PLCC44 sockets). Treat these as assembly choices and verify fit against the PCB.
- The older packing list differs from this KiCad CSV for some headers (including J8). This table follows the CSV; inspect the current PCB before ordering those headers.

The source CSV has no supplier or manufacturer part numbers. Package names in this table are KiCad footprint identifiers, not vendor order codes.
